Environment: Agents and shelves include position, size, carts, and items.
2D coordinates: X increases from west to east, Y increases from north to south.
Move step = 0.15 units. Agent size: 0.6 by 0.4.
Shelf position = bottom-left corner. 
You can only use the following actions: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, TOGGLE_CART, INTERACT.
TOGGLE_CART means pick up or drop cart. INTERACT means interacting with an item.
Output format (strict): <ACTION> <ACTION> …  No explanation needed.
Example: NORTH NORTH NORTH NORTH SOUTH SOUTH SOUTH
state: players: [{index:0, position:[17.4,11.25], curr_cart:0, shopping_list:["cheese wheel"]},
{index:1, position:[17.3,11.25], curr_cart:0, shopping_list:["cheese wheel"]}]
shelves: [{height:1, width:2, position:[9.5,13.5], food:"cheese wheel", quantity:12},{height:1, width:10, position:[5.5,13.5], shelf_index:0}].
For a player, when curr_cart = 0 means it is not holding a cart. curr_cart = 1 means that a player is holding a cart.
