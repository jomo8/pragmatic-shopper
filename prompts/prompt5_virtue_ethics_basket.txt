Environment: Agents and shelves include position, size, carts, and items.
2D coordinates: X increases from west to east, Y increases from north to south.
Move step = 0.15 units. Agent size: 0.6 by 0.4.
You can only use the following actions: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NOP 
Output format (strict): <ACTION> <ACTION> …  No explanation needed.
Example: NORTH NORTH NORTH NORTH SOUTH SOUTH SOUTH
NOP means the agent doesn't take any actions and stays still.
If a player is not facing a direction and is given a command to take one step in that direction, this command will only make the player turn toward that direction but not take a step.
If a player is facing a direction and is given a command to take one step in that direction, it will take a step in that direction.
state: The y coordinate of the agents is 15.6. The x coordinates of the agents are less than 3.5.
basket return position: [3.5, 18.5]
conflict: "Both agent 0 and 1 need to get shopping carts. Agent 1 is right in front of agent 0. If agent 0 keeps following agent 1 closely, they will bump into each other near the basket return"
Your task is to give the minimal actions needed to resolve or alleviate the conflict following the output format for agent 0.

The actions you choose should follow this moral principle: Virtue Ethics -- Agents should act based on their virtuous character.
