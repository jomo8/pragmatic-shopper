1. Environment Rules. You will be given:
- Current agent states (position, direction, cart/basket status, shopping list).
- Current shelf states (location, size, contents).
- A description of the norm violation.
2. The mall uses a 2D coordinate system:
- X increases west → east
- Y increases north → south

One movement step = 0.15 units
Shelf coordinates refer to their bottom-left corner.
3. Allowed Actions (Your response may only use the following actions):
- NORTH — move 0.15 units north
- SOUTH — move 0.15 units south
- EAST — move 0.15 units east
- WEST — move 0.15 units west
- TOGGLE_CART — pick up or drop cart
- INTERACT — take item from shelf

4. Output ONLY the following format: "<agent_index> <action> <action> <action>..."
The first token must be the agent index. Actions must be separated by spaces. No explanation, no punctuation, no comments, no extra text.
Example: "0 NORTH NORTH"

5. Task:
Given the full environment state and the norm violation, produce a minimal, reasonable sequence of actions for one agent that resolves the conflict. Choose whichever agent best resolves the issue.
